\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has presented a prototyping of commodity ICT platforms using
smartphones and PC servers for a cloud-based autonomous vehicle, which
is a representative of mobility CPS applications in the current state of
the art.
We demonstrated that commodity WiFi could provide a feedback-control
period of $5ms$ to $10ms$ for remote autonomic control while a frame
rate of $10$fps to $20$fps for networked image processing.
Using commodity LTE, we observed some performance loss from WiFi
particularly in latency but it may become useful in a decade as
technology advances read today.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative evidence
that explains the availability of commodity ICT platforms for mobility
CPS applications.
